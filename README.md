## Try it now

There are several ways to use Purplship:

- [Purplship Cloud](https://cloud.purplship.com) let's you use the fullset of shipping features. you don't need to deploy anything. We will manage and scale your infrastructure.
- [Purplship OSS](#purplship-oss) is an open-source version of purplship that provides the core functionality of purplship (rating API, tracking API, shipping API), but lacks more advanced features (multi-tenant/orgs, shipping billing data, built-in address validation, etc.)
- [Purplship SDK](#purplship-sdk) is the core of the purplship abstraction layer. It can be installed as a simple set of python libraries to do the low level carrier integration yourself.
