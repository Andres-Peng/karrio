# REST API


## The Multi-carrier Shipping API

Purplship shipping API is powered by REST. Rather than dealing with non-standardized, 
often poorly documented carrier webservices and arcane technologies such as SOAP. Purplship
proposes a unified and intuitive REST API compatible for all supported carriers services.


## API References

Purplship exposes a set of REST API resources. The full references are accessible at `/openapi/`
for the full description of the service APIs from your browser.
